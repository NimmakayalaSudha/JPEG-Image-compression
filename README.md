# JPEG Image Compression using hardware efficient OBC and CORDIC algorithms
•OBC and CORDIC are hardware optimisation techniques that replaces traditional multiplication technique used in
JPEG while performing DCT and IDCT operations.
•Implemented in Verilog by taking black and white image and verified image compression results in MATLAB.
