# JPEG Image Compression using hardware efficient OBC and CORDIC algorithms

•OBC and CORDIC are hardware optimisation techniques that replaces traditional multiplication technique used in
JPEG while performing DCT and IDCT operations.

•Implemented in Verilog by taking black and white image from .coe file and verified image compression results in MATLAB.


 The process of uploading image pixels from coe file to vivado is presented in DCT.pdf from pg no. 25 to 33
